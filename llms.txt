## Icon Styles

The library includes four distinct style variants:

- **Base**: The default outlined style with clean pixel edges
- **Sharp**: Sharper corners and more angular appearance
- **Glyph**: Filled solid icons with interior details
- **Solid**: Completely filled icons without interior detail

## Technical Specifications

- **Grid Size**: 24x24 pixels
- **Scaling**: Must scale in multiples (12px, 24px, 48px, 72px, 96px) to maintain crisp pixel edges
- **Formats Available**: PNG (free preview), SVG (Pro version)
- **Total Icons**: 2131+ icons across all styles

## Usage Guidelines

1. Scale only in multiples of the base size (24px)
2. Disable anti-aliasing/smoothing when displaying
3. For CSS: use `image-rendering: pixelated`
4. Icons work best on light or dark solid backgrounds
